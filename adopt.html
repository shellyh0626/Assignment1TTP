        We understand that it can be incredibly difficult to let go of your
        beloved pet for any reason. We want to express our gratitude for
        trusting us with your pet's well-being. By choosing to leave your pet
        here at our shelter, you are providing them with a safe and caring
        environment, rather than leaving them to fend for themselves in the
        wild. Thank you for making this compassionate choice.

        Adopt pets instead of buying, by adopting, you are giving a loving home
        to an animal in need. Many animals in shelters are abandoned, stray, or
        surrendered, and by adopting them, you are providing a second chance at
        a happy life.
